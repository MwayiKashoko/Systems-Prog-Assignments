- Test #1:

A test on the 20 url file without top

For the testing the programs both produce exactly the same result. 1

- Test #2:

A test with an incorrect file name for the evalbad scripts

For the shell script it says that the file does not exist and exits. In the Python script it gives an error because the file does not exist. 2

A test with the 20 url file using top

This time both files produce the same results. 3

- Test #4

A test with an empty file

Both files produce the same results with 0 ips and 0 domain names 4

- Test #5

A test on the 20 url file which I have corrupted 10%

Again both files produce the same results with the same ips, domains, and same value for the ip that shows up the most.  5

5/5 for correct test output. 5 total tests
